                    Hello, my name is Phil Aung. I am a curious and fast
                    learning Burmese soul from LA. A software engineer with a
                    strong backend background from college. Well versed on
                    top-down and bottom-up designing aspects of programs. I am a
                    team player and aspire to be the best version of me on every
                    occasion. Born into and raised by Physicists parents, my
                    love toward electronics runs deep, and I am passionate about
                    computers with problem solving at the core of it.
